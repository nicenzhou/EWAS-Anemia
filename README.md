# EWAS-Anemia

These data files are used to support the findings in the paper 'Environment-Wide Association Studies of Anemia in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys'.

### Abstract
Background:
Anemia, a global health problem, can lead to chronic illness in adults and may be fatal in children and the elderly. While some dietary factors and heavy metals are known risk factors for anemia, there are no environment-wide studies of anemia.

Objectives:
Our goal was to identify the environment-wide risk factors for anemia. 

Methods:
We evaluated general anemia in children and adults and further classified anemia as a) iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency anemia; b) anemia in general chronic diseases; and c) anemia in chronic kidney disease. Environment-wide association studies (EWAS) were performed to identify novel environmental risk factors of anemia in discovery and replication subsets of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES).

Results:
We identified and replicated 106 potential environmental risk factors for anemia. In children, serum iron was associated with folic acid supplements and vitamin A supplements. Multiple polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane were also associated with hemoglobin concentration and red blood cell folate concentration for children from the discovery analysis (1999–2002). As expected, serum iron was the top exposure associated with general anemia for adults. Cadmium was associated with adult hemoglobin levels, as were vitamin Bs, micronutrients, smoking, and alcohol consumption. Further, decreased level of multiple vitamins, including vitamin A, vitamin Es and multiple vitamin Bs, were associated with anemia in adults. Use of tobacco and alcohol was also found to be associated with red blood cell folate and serum iron levels. 

Discussion:
This is the first EWAS of anemia, providing insights into the environmental etiology of anemia risk in children and adults. These results may lead to the development of public health recommendations to mitigate anemia risk factors.
