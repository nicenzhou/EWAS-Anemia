# Environment-Wide Association Studies of Anemia in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (EWAS Anemia)

These data files support the findings in 'Environment-Wide Association Studies of Anemia in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys'.

We performed the first environment-wide association studies (EWAS) of anemia using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES), evaluating general anemia and specific subtypes (iron, vitamin B12, or folate deficiency; chronic disease-related; and chronic kidney disease-related) in both children and adults.

**Key Findings:**
- Identified and replicated 106 environmental risk factors for anemia
- **In children**: Serum iron associated with folic acid and vitamin A supplements; multiple PCBs and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane linked to hemoglobin and RBC folate levels
- **In adults**: Serum iron was the top risk factor; cadmium, vitamin Bs, micronutrients, smoking, and alcohol consumption associated with hemoglobin levels; decreased vitamins A, E, and Bs linked to anemia

These results provide insights into the environmental etiology of anemia and may inform public health recommendations to mitigate risk factors.

## Data and Analysis
### 1. National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
The [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) are conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to evaluate the health and nutritional status of the US population ([Cousins 2014](); [Le 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0166635); [McFarlane et al. 2008](https://www.clinicalkey.com/#!/content/playContent/1-s2.0-S0272638608000073?returnurl=https:%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0272638608000073%3Fshowall%3Dtrue&referrer=https:%2F%2Fpubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov%2F); [Patel et al. 2009](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2747286/)). The goal of NHANES is to identify risk factors for prevalent diseases to aid in developing effective public health policies. The demographic information, dietary recalls, health surveys, toxin exposures, and laboratory measurements of the participants were collected by interviews and physical examinations at home or at a mobile exam center (Cousins 2014). The current study including 41,474 individuals and 1,191 variables before quality control (QC) from survey years 1999–2006 was pulled from the unified dataset ([Patel et al. 2016](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0010746)).

### 2. Requirements
This analysis requires to use [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [qulity-control (QC) algorithm](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2019.01240/full)/[CLARITE package in R](https://github.com/HallLab/clarite) for Environment-wide association study (EWAS) that was pulished before. All other required packages were listed in the main code files. The [unified NHANES dataset](https://pic-sure.org/products/nhanes-unified-dataset) for year 1999-2006 are required. 

### 3. Codes
It contains a [R Markdown file](Codes/EWAS_Anemia_Notebook.Rmd) to perform all the analyses and two seperate R files for generating the [Mahanttan](Codes/ManhattanPlots_Revised.R) and [Hudson](Codes/HudsonPlots_Revised.R) Plots based on the results. The raw files for plotting the network plot were also stored in the file named Cytoscape for Network which can be read by using [Cytoscape](https://cytoscape.org/).

### 4. Data
All data, including [main table](Data/Main Table/MainTable_keepvar_over18.tsv), download SAS files, files for survery weight and plots, and files for variable desciptions, except the original unified data (more than 100 MB) were uploaded into Data folder. 

### 5. Plots
It contains 1. the original plots that were generated by using eman function in CALRITE package, 2. the labeled plots with annotations for the significant results, and 3. modified Manhattan plot and Hudson plots for the manuscripts. 

### 6. R
It contains two modified R scripts for stroing only the modified functions to plot the modified [Manhattan](R/modifiedeman.R) and [Hudson](R/modifiedhudson.R) Plots. 

### 7. Results
All the results were uploaded to here for each EWAS.
